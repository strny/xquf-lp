XQuery Update Facility Locking Protocol

This project is the implementation of XQuery Update Facility Locking Protocol in [Maude](http://maude.cs.uiuc.edu/) . The target of this project is to provide verifiable implementation of the XQUF semantics including XQUF-LP protocol. This can be used to verify theoretic properties of the protocol such as confluence. We suppose that this implementation could be useful to test new features of the language.
